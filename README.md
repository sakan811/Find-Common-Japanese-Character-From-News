# Common Japanese Words in News

Showcase visualizations and code base about the common Japanese words that appear in news.

This project was built on top of [Common Japanese Morphemes in News](#common-japanese-morphemes-in-news) project.

Combining morphemes collected from [Common Japanese Morphemes in News](#common-japanese-morphemes-in-news) project into
words by looking them up in the dictionary.

Words that aren't in the dictionary were filtered out.

The Japanese dictionary for word-lookup is based on JMdict: https://github.com/themoeway/jmdict-yomitan

- You **need** to have **news urls** from **NHK News** **stored** in the **SQLite database** first before running this script.
  - Which means you **should run** [main.py](main.py) to **scrape morphemes** from the **NHK News** first.

    ```
- Run [morpheme_to_word.py](morpheme_to_word.py)

  1. It fetches the news urls stored in NewsUrls table in the database and scraped the news article.
  2. It extracts morphemes from the articles, clean non-Japanese characters, and combines them into words by looking up
    the words in the dictionary.
